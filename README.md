# Autonomous Car

### Algorithm works for a Subaru-WRX, using Reinforcement Learning to predict the best possible gear shits and fuel economy combination to get the lowest possible time on any given route/track.

**Usage: python car.py ./X.csv 
 where X is the name of the track file you would like to run.**

#### Fork the repo and make changes to the car.py file and try it on the car of your own choice.

**PS: Feel free to contact me for any questions.**
